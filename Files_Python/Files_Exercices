Some beginner-level project ideas that involve practicing file access operations in Python:

Text File Analyzer: Create a program that reads a text file and computes some basic statistics, such as the number of lines, words, and characters. You could also extend this to count the frequency of each word or character.

Contact Book: Develop a simple contact book application where you can add, view, edit, and delete contacts. Each contact could have information like name, phone number, and email address, and all this information is stored in a file.

Quiz Game: Build a quiz game that reads questions and answers from a file. The program should present these questions to the user, take their answers, and then score the quiz at the end.

Expense Tracker: Create a basic expense tracker where you can log expenses. The program should allow adding new expenses, listing all recorded expenses, and maybe even categorizing them. All data should be saved to a file.

Diary/Journal App: Make a simple diary or journal application where you can write new entries, read old ones, and search for entries by date. Each entry could be stored as a separate file or all entries could be in one file, separated by date.

To-Do List: Implement a to-do list where tasks can be added, completed, and deleted. The state of the to-do list should be preserved in a file so that it persists between runs of the program.

Inventory Management: Create a basic inventory management system for a small business or personal use. It should allow adding new items, updating existing ones, deleting items, and listing all items in the inventory. All data should be stored in a file.

Bookmark Manager: Develop a simple bookmark manager where you can save, edit, delete, and categorize website URLs. It could also include features like tagging and searching bookmarks.

Recipe Manager: Make a program that can store, retrieve, and organize recipes. Users should be able to add new recipes, view existing ones, and search for recipes based on ingredients or names.

Log Parser: Write a script that can parse log files (like server logs, application logs, etc.) and extract specific information, such as error messages or specific events. This can be a good way to learn about regular expressions along with file handling.
